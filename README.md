# DBMS-Assignment

# In this assignment,we had  to implement a concurrency control algorithm for an airline database. The system consists of a transaction 

# threads, concurrency control manager and an airline database. The database has a set of transactions and data structures containing 

# flight information (passenger lists for all flights). 

# The goal is to study performance improvements based on the granularity of locking. The first version of the program implements only 

# serial schedules (lock the entire database).Then the performance is compared with the second version which does two-phase locking at 

# a more fine-grained level
